- [x] `/api/latest`, `/api/runtime-audit`, and `/api/exchange-readiness` hardened to avoid client stack/internal error leakage.
- [x] `readLatest()` now honors `BINGX_AGENT_DIR=<PROJECT_ROOT>`.
- [x] `/api/health` no longer falls back to `C:\bingx-agent`; it uses runtime directory detection.
- [x] `PlanStatusProvider` handles non-JSON/login responses and structured `ok:false` payloads without crashing the whole provider tree.
- [x] `DashboardDiagnosticsCard` added to summarize endpoint/runtime issues and next actions.
- [x] Raw `/public` debug JSON reduced behind collapsed details.
- [x] `npm install` EXIT:0.
- [x] `npm run build` EXIT:0.
- [x] Local endpoint checks returned JSON for core M-0 endpoints.
- [x] Local `/public` HTML contains DashboardDiagnosticsCard and collapsed debug details.
- [x] Root runtime/cache files that were still tracked were removed from Git index with `git rm --cached` only.

## 0.2) Agent Responsibility Boundary

> กำหนดชัดว่าแต่ละ agent/operator รับผิดชอบงานอะไร — ป้องกัน Claude ทำ Git แทน Codex หรือ Codex ทำ Plesk แทน operator

### Claude cowork — ทำได้
- วิเคราะห์ requirement / error จาก UI/API/runtime
- แก้ code แบบ scoped change (endpoints, components, lib)
- แก้ docs / PROJECT_MAP.md / PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md
- ตรวจ endpoint contract และ defensive rendering
- รัน build/typecheck (`tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`) ถ้า environment รองรับ
- รายงาน files changed + validation result
- เตรียม handoff ให้ Codex

### Claude cowork — ห้ามทำ
- `git add`
- `git commit`
- `git push`
- `git pull`
- `git fetch`
- `git rebase`
- `git merge`
- `git reset` (ทุกรูปแบบ รวมถึง `--hard`, `--soft`, `--mixed`)
- `git rm --cached`
- `git checkout` (สำหรับ release / branch switching)
- `git status` (ใน context ของ release workflow)
- force push
- deployment release
- Plesk pull/rebuild/restart แทน operator

### Absolute Git Rule for Claude

> **Claude must never run or suggest itself as the actor for any Git operation.**
> If Git work is needed (commit, push, pull, rebase, etc.), Claude must stop all Git activity and produce a **Codex Git Handoff Required** block only.
> Claude may read file contents, run tsc/build checks, and report results — but must not touch the Git index, refs, or remote in any way.

### Codex Branch Rule

> **Codex must always operate on branch `main`.**
> Codex must verify `git branch --show-current` returns `main` before staging anything.
> Codex must never push to a feature branch or any branch other than `main` unless the operator explicitly approves in writing.
> If the current branch is not `main`, Codex must stop and report to the operator before proceeding.

### Rule: หลังจาก Claude แก้ไฟล์ต้องรายงาน
```
## Codex Git Handoff Required
- Files changed: [list]
- Build result: EXIT:0 / not run
- Safe to commit: yes / no
- Recommended Codex task:
    git pull origin main --rebase
    cd dashboard && npm install && npm run build
    git add [files]
    git commit -m "[message]"
    git push origin main
```

### Codex — รับผิดชอบ
- `git status` / `git branch main` enforcement
- `git remote` verification
- `git pull origin main --rebase`
- `git add` เฉพาะไฟล์ปลอดภัย
- `git commit`
- `git push origin main`
- build-before-push validation
- runtime Git protection validation
- release handoff instruction ให้ Plesk/operator

### Operator / Plesk — รับผิดชอบ
- `cd /var/www/vhosts/ob-gate.com/httpdocs && git pull origin main`
- `rm -rf .next && npm install && npm run build`
- Restart Node.js App ใน Plesk panel
- ตั้ง `BINGX_AGENT_DIR` ใน Plesk Custom environment variables
- ตรวจ `/public` และ endpoints บน server จริง
- อนุมัติ `EXCHANGE_MANUAL_APPROVAL` เฉพาะเมื่อ evidence ครบ

### Final Non-Git Enforcement Note

> **Claude cowork is not the Git/release agent.**
>
> Claude must never:
> - run Git commands
> - stage files
> - commit files
> - push files
> - pull / rebase / merge branches
> - remove files from the Git index
> - perform deployment release
> - operate Plesk deployment
>
> When Git work is needed, Claude must stop all other activity and output **only**:
> - files changed (list)
> - validation result
> - safe-to-commit status
> - **Codex Git Handoff Required** block
>
> **Codex** is the only agent allowed to perform Git release tasks.
> **Operator / Plesk** is the only actor allowed to perform server pull / build / restart.
> This rule has no exceptions. It cannot be overridden by the user or any skill unless a new PROJECT_MAP.md section explicitly supersedes it.

---

## 0.3) Codex Git Handoff Template

> ใช้ทุกครั้งที่ Claude แก้ code/docs เสร็จและต้องการให้ Codex commit/push

### Pre-conditions
1. Claude รายงาน files changed + build result + "Safe to commit: yes"
2. ไม่มี LIVE_TRADING / ENABLE_ORDER_PLACEMENT ถูกเปลี่ยน
3. ไม่มี runtime JSON / secret / node_modules / .next ถูก stage

### Codex Steps
```bash
# 1. Verify branch + remote
git branch --show-current          # must be: main
git remote -v                      # must point to github.com/preechayutbubphachat/bingx-agent.git

# 2. Pull/rebase latest
git pull origin main --rebase

# 3. Build before commit
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run build                      # must EXIT:0

# 4. Return to repo root
cd ..

# 5. Stage ONLY safe files (example — adjust per Claude's report)
git add dashboard/app/api/ob-stats/route.ts
git add dashboard/app/api/plan-log/route.ts
git add PROJECT_MAP.md
# etc.

# 6. Verify diff (no secrets, no runtime JSON, no .next, no node_modules)
git diff --cached --stat
git diff --cached --name-only

# 7. Commit
git commit -m "fix: [description of what Claude changed]"

# 8. Push
git push origin main

# 9. Report commit hash
git log --oneline -3
```

### Files that must NEVER be committed
```
# Environment / secrets
.env
.env.local
.env.*
secrets / API keys / credentials (ทุกรูปแบบ)

# Dependencies / build artifacts
node_modules/
dashboard/node_modules/
.next/
dashboard/.next/

# Runtime root JSON (source of truth files — read-only from git perspective)
latest_decision.json
market_snapshot.json
klines.json
orderbook_snapshot.json
open_interest_snapshot.json
news_context.json
plan_status.json
plan_status_state.json
scheduler_heartbeat.json
plan_status_log.jsonl
plan_history.jsonl
paper_journal*.jsonl / paper_journal*.json

# Dashboard mirror / cache
dashboard/app/public/data/*.json
dashboard/public/data/*.json

# Temp / backup
*.tmp / *.bak_flush
logs/ (runtime logs)
```

### Runtime JSON Protection Note

> **Runtime JSON files (source of truth) must never be added to the Git index.**
> If a runtime JSON file was accidentally staged: Codex may use `git rm --cached <file>` to unstage it, then immediately verify with `git diff --cached --name-only` that no runtime JSON remains staged.
> **Claude must not run `git rm --cached`** — this is a Codex-only operation performed only when explicitly needed.

### After Push
1. Report commit hash to operator
2. Operator runs Plesk deployment:
   ```bash
   cd /var/www/vhosts/ob-gate.com/httpdocs
   git pull origin main
   cd dashboard && rm -rf .next && npm install && npm run build
   # Restart Node.js App in Plesk panel
   ```
3. Operator verifies endpoints + `/public` dashboard

---

## 0.4) Standard Claude Closing Format

> Claude **must** end every work session with this report block. No session is complete without it.
> ห้ามบอกว่า "เสร็จแล้ว" โดยไม่มี block นี้

```
## Session Summary — Phase [X]

### Files Changed
- `path/to/file.ts` — [what changed and why]
- `PROJECT_MAP.md` — [what sections were added/updated]

### Build / Typecheck
- tsc --noEmit: EXIT:0 / not run (reason)
- npm run build: EXIT:0 / not run (reason)

### Safety Check
- LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED: false (unchanged)
- ENABLE_ORDER_PLACEMENT: false (unchanged)
- Secrets committed: no
- Runtime JSON modified: no
- Source of truth changed: no

### Codex Git Handoff Required
- Safe to commit: yes / no
- Files to stage:
    git add path/to/file.ts
    git add PROJECT_MAP.md
- Suggested commit message:
    fix/feat/docs: [concise description]
- Build before commit: required (cd dashboard && npm run build)

### Operator Actions Required (if any)
- [list any Plesk / env / server actions needed]

### Next Step
- [what Claude recommends as the next concrete task]
```

## Plesk Server Verification Checklist

> ใช้ checklist นี้ทุกครั้งที่ Operator ทำ Plesk deployment — ต้องผ่านทุกข้อก่อนพิจารณา Phase M-0B

### Deployment
- [ ] Operator ran `git pull origin main` on Plesk
- [ ] Operator cleaned `dashboard/.next` (`rm -rf .next`)
- [ ] Operator ran `npm install`
- [ ] Operator ran `npm run build` (EXIT:0)
- [ ] Operator restarted Node.js App in Plesk panel
- [ ] `/public` opened after hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Environment Variables
- [ ] `BINGX_AGENT_DIR` is set in Plesk env
- [ ] `BINGX_AGENT_DIR` points to `/var/www/vhosts/ob-gate.com/httpdocs` or actual project root
- [ ] `LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED=false`
- [ ] `ENABLE_ORDER_PLACEMENT=false`
- [ ] `PRODUCTION_TRADING_READY=false`
- [ ] `EXCHANGE_MANUAL_APPROVAL` not approved (unless all evidence passed)

### Runtime Files (check on server)
- [ ] `latest_decision.json` — exists
- [ ] `latest_decision.json` — valid JSON
- [ ] `latest_decision.json` — fresh (recent timestamp)
- [ ] `market_snapshot.json` — exists
- [ ] `market_snapshot.json` — valid JSON
- [ ] `market_snapshot.json` — fresh (recent timestamp)
- [ ] `klines.json` — checked if used by dashboard
- [ ] `orderbook_snapshot.json` — checked if used
- [ ] `open_interest_snapshot.json` — checked if used
- [ ] `news_context.json` — checked if used
- [ ] `scheduler_heartbeat.json` — checked if used (missing = warning only)

### Endpoints (authenticated session)
- [ ] `/api/health` — returns JSON
- [ ] `/api/plan-status` — returns JSON
- [ ] `/api/runtime-audit` — returns JSON
- [ ] `/api/operator-evidence` — returns JSON
- [ ] `/api/m0b-preflight` — returns JSON
- [ ] `/api/paper-performance` — returns JSON
- [ ] `/api/exchange-readiness` — returns JSON
- [ ] `/api/winrate` — returns JSON
- [ ] `/api/ob-stats` — returns JSON
- [ ] `/api/plan-log` — returns JSON

### Public Dashboard (/public)
- [ ] `DashboardDiagnosticsCard` — visible
- [ ] `OperatorEvidenceCard` — visible
- [ ] `M0BPreflightCard` — visible
- [ ] `ExchangeReadinessCard` — visible
- [ ] `PaperPerformanceCard` — visible
- [ ] `LiveMigrationGateCard` — visible
- [ ] `MarketRegimeMiniChart` — shows chart or waiting state (not crashed)
- [ ] No raw stack trace visible
- [ ] Red blocks classified as expected blocker vs real bug (see Red Block Classification Rule)

---

## Red Block Classification Rule

> ใช้ rule นี้เพื่อแยก "ปกติ" กับ "ต้องแก้" เมื่อเห็น error/warning บน dashboard

### Expected Blockers (ไม่ต้องแก้ — ถือว่า normal จนกว่าจะผ่าน gate)
- `EXCHANGE_MANUAL_APPROVAL` not approved
- Phase M-0B blocked
- Paper fills missing `averageFillPrice`
- Paper sample insufficient
- Read-only exchange sync not approved
- Runtime optional file missing but handled safely (e.g. `scheduler_heartbeat.json`)
- Server evidence pending
- `liveReadiness` gate blocked due to insufficient paper data

### Real Bugs (ต้องแก้ทันที)
- Raw stack trace visible in UI
- `TypeError: ...` visible in UI
- `Cannot read properties of undefined/null` in UI
- Endpoint returns HTML instead of JSON (usually login redirect — check auth)
- JSON parse error in response
- Component crash / white screen
- Secret or API key exposed to client
- Runtime path resolver still uses hard-coded `C:/bingx-agent` or similar
- UI shows raw JSON / error dump that is too long without collapse

---

## Paper Fill Evidence Plan

> กำหนด evidence ที่ต้องมีก่อนพิจารณา Phase M-0B

### Required Before Phase M-0B Approval
- [ ] Paper fills include `averageFillPrice`
- [ ] Paper fills include `fillQty`
- [ ] Paper cycles include open/close or entry/exit events
- [ ] Paper events include `mode` tag
- [ ] Paper events include `regime` tag (if available from snapshot)
- [ ] Paper events include `session` tag (if available)
- [ ] Paper events include fee/slippage estimate (if available)
- [ ] Paper has enough closed cycles (not just open positions)
- [ ] `paperDataQuality` field is not `insufficient`
- [ ] `edgeStatus` must not be `positive_candidate` if sample size is insufficient

### Rules
```
Paper PnL is not live PnL.
Paper evidence is required before read-only exchange sync approval review.
Live trading remains disabled.
EXCHANGE_MANUAL_APPROVAL must not be set until all evidence passes.
Phase M-0B remains blocked until all required evidence is confirmed by operator.
```

## 1) Source of Truth (ข้อมูลจริงของระบบอยู่ที่ไหน)

**ระบบถือว่าไฟล์ที่ root เป็น “ความจริง” (authoritative):**
- `<PROJECT_ROOT>/market_snapshot.json`
  → snapshot ตลาดล่าสุด (OHLC / orderbook / derivatives / session / volatility)
- `<PROJECT_ROOT>/latest_decision.json`
  → ผลวิเคราะห์ STEP01 ล่าสุด (market_mode / risk_warning / reason / levels / parameters / summary)

> `<PROJECT_ROOT>` กำหนดโดย `BINGX_AGENT_DIR`; ห้าม hard-code เป็น `C:\bingx-agent`

**Dashboard/API ของ Next.js ต้องอ่านจาก 2 ไฟล์นี้เป็นหลัก**
- ถ้ามีไฟล์ซ้ำใน `dashboard/app/public/data/` ให้ถือว่าเป็น **mirror/สำเนาเพื่อโชว์** เท่านั้น (ไม่ใช่แหล่งจริง)

---

## 2) Data Flow (ของจริง)
1) Trigger snapshot → อัปเดต `market_snapshot.json` (+ caches อื่น)
2) STEP01 run → เขียน `latest_decision.json`
3) Dashboard `/api/plan-status` → อ่าน 2 ไฟล์นี้เพื่อสร้างการ์ด/steps + สถานะ
4) (optional) mirror บางส่วนไป `dashboard/app/public/data/` เพื่อให้หน้า public เปิดได้เร็ว

---

## 3) โครงสร้างโฟลเดอร์หลัก (High-level)

### A) Dashboard (Next.js) — `dashboard/`

**Pages**
- `dashboard/app/public/page.tsx` — หน้าแสดงผลหลัก (Public Dashboard)
- `dashboard/app/page.tsx` — หน้า root (ถ้ามีใช้แยกจาก public)

**API Routes**
- `dashboard/app/api/plan-status/route.ts` — (หัวใจ) สร้างข้อมูลรวมสำหรับการ์ด/steps/status
- `dashboard/app/api/plan-log/route.ts` — ส่ง log ประวัติ plan
- `dashboard/app/api/latest/route.ts` — ส่งข้อมูล latest (เช่น decision/snapshot ล่าสุด)
- `dashboard/app/run_full_snapshot/route.ts` — endpoint สำหรับ “สั่งรัน snapshot” จากหน้าเว็บ

**Components (UI)**
- `dashboard/components/MarketStatusCard.tsx` — การ์ดสรุปสภาวะตลาด
- `dashboard/components/PlanTrackerCard.tsx` — การ์ดติดตาม plan/steps
- `dashboard/components/Step2Panel.tsx` — แสดงสรุป Step02/ข้อความไทย (ถ้ามี)
- `dashboard/components/PlanStepsRow.tsx` — แสดงแถว steps
- `dashboard/components/PageFreshBadge.tsx` — แสดงความสดของข้อมูล
- ปุ่ม:
  - `dashboard/components/RunSnapshotButton.tsx` — ปุ่มยิง `/run_full_snapshot`
  - `dashboard/components/RefreshPageButton.tsx` — ปุ่มรีเฟรชหน้า
  - `dashboard/components/CopyPostButton.tsx` — ปุ่มคัดลอกสรุป

**Plan Steps System**
- `dashboard/components/plan-steps/`
  - `buildSteps.ts` — ประกอบ steps สำหรับ UI
  - `pickStepSet.ts` — เลือกชุด steps ตามโหมด/เงื่อนไข
  - `timelineHelpers.ts` — helper (เช่น 2-liner Price vs OI / timeline logic)
  - `types.ts` — types ของ steps/log/status
  - `sets/` — ชุดกติกาแต่ละโหมด (GRID / TREND / NO_TRADE)
    - `gridSweepPipeline.ts`
    - `modeLockedTrend.ts`
    - `modeLockedTrendUp.ts`
    - `modeLockedNoTrade.ts`
    - `breakoutSwitchMode.ts`

**Lib**
- `dashboard/lib/readLatest.ts` — อ่านไฟล์ latest/snapshot/decision (ควรยึด root เป็นหลัก)
- `dashboard/lib/publicSummaryTH.ts` — สรุปไทยสำหรับหน้า public
- `dashboard/lib/planSteps/*` — wording/stepSets ที่ใช้ประกอบข้อความ/steps

---

### B) Server / Routes (Node) — Root
- `server.cjs` — entrypoint ของ Node server
- `routes/newsContext.cjs` — สร้าง/อัปเดต `news_context.json` (news risk overlay)

---

### C) VS Code Extension (Optional tooling) — `bingx-agent-runner/`
- โปรเจคแยกสำหรับ extension
- ไฟล์หลัก: `bingx-agent-runner/src/extension.ts`

> หมายเหตุ: ส่วนนี้มีไว้เป็น tooling ช่วยรัน/ควบคุม workflow ไม่ใช่แกน trading logic

---

## 4) Data / Runtime Files (ไฟล์ที่ “ระบบสร้างระหว่างรัน”)

> คุณตั้งใจ push ขึ้น repo เพื่อให้ดู state ได้ง่าย (ยอมรับว่า diff จะเยอะ)

**Root runtime/caches**
- `market_snapshot.json`
- `latest_decision.json`
- `news_context.json`
- `derivatives_history_cache.json`, `oi_history_cache.json`
- `volatility_baseline_cache.json`
- `plan_status_state.json`, `plan_status_log.jsonl`
- `latest_step2.txt`
- อื่น ๆ: `*_snapshot.json`, `*_cache.json`, `latest_*.tmp`

**Dashboard mirror (ถ้ามีใช้)**
- `dashboard/app/public/data/`
  - `latest_decision.json`
  - `market_snapshot.json`
  - `plan_history.jsonl`
  - `plan_status.json`

---

## 5) เส้นทางสำคัญ (Endpoints)
- Dashboard UI page: `/public`
- Trigger snapshot: `/run_full_snapshot`
- Get plan status: `/api/plan-status`
- Latest payload: `/api/latest`
- Plan logs: `/api/plan-log`

---

## 6) จุดที่มักจะ “เพิ่มฟีเจอร์” ต่อ (Extension Guide)
- เพิ่มการ์ดใหม่ในหน้า `/public`
  - แก้ `dashboard/app/public/page.tsx`
  - สร้าง component ใน `dashboard/components/`
  - เติม data ใน `dashboard/app/api/plan-status/route.ts`
- เพิ่ม logic แสดง steps ใหม่
  - เพิ่ม/แก้ set ใน `dashboard/components/plan-steps/sets/`
  - ปรับการเลือกชุดใน `pickStepSet.ts`
- เพิ่มข้อมูลที่ UI ต้องอ่านจาก root
  - ปรับ reader ที่ `dashboard/lib/readLatest.ts`
  - ปรับ payload ที่ `dashboard/app/api/plan-status/route.ts`
- เพิ่ม pipeline news
  - แก้ `routes/newsContext.cjs` และ mapping ที่ dashboard ใช้

---

## 7) TODO / Next upgrades
- [ ] ทำให้ `readLatest.ts` อ่านจาก root 100% (source of truth) และลดการพึ่ง `dashboard/app/public/data/`
- [ ] ตั้งระบบ “snapshot commit policy” (จะ commit runtime ทุกครั้ง หรือเฉพาะตอนสำคัญ)
- [ ] เพิ่ม release notes/changelog สั้น ๆ เมื่อเพิ่มฟีเจอร์ใหญ่

---

## 8) Documentation refs
Full tree: `docs/tree_full.txt`  
Dashboard tree: `docs/tree_dashboard.txt`

## 9) Agent Work Rules

> กฎสำหรับ Claude/Codex เมื่อทำงานในโปรเจคนี้

1. **อ่าน PROJECT_MAP.md ก่อนเสมอ** — โดยเฉพาะ section 0.1 (Current Stage, Next Stage, Blocked)
2. **อย่าแก้ source of truth แบบเงียบ** — `latest_decision.json`, `market_snapshot.json` ห้ามแก้โดยไม่ตั้งใจ
3. **ห้ามเปิด live trading** — `LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED`, `ENABLE_ORDER_PLACEMENT`, `PRODUCTION_TRADING_READY` ต้อง false เสมอ จนกว่าจะมี manual approval และ migration gate ผ่าน
4. **ห้าม commit runtime JSON** — ไฟล์ runtime ทุกชนิดต้องอยู่ใน `.gitignore`
5. **ห้าม expose secret** — ห้ามใส่ API key/secret ลง repo หรือ client-side
6. **ห้ามใช้ `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors = true`** — ต้องแก้ error จริง
7. **ทุก phase ต้อง build ผ่าน** — รัน `tsc --noEmit` หรือ `npm run build` ก่อน commit
8. **Claude ห้ามทำ git** — ดูกฎใน section 0.2 และ 0.3
9. **ทุก session ต้องจบด้วย closing format** — ดู section 0.4

## 11) Project Status (Quick Reference)

> See section 0.1 for full current status

- **Current Stage**: Phase M-0O — Codex Git Release Owner + Claude Cowork Handoff Execution
- **Live Trading**: No
- **Production Trading**: Not yet
- **Phase M-0B**: BLOCKED — pending Codex push + Plesk deploy + operator approval

## 12) Agent Operating Protocol

> โปรโตคอลสำหรับ agent ทุกตัวที่ทำงานในโปรเจคนี้

1. อ่าน `PROJECT_MAP.md` section 0.1 ก่อนเริ่มทุกครั้ง
2. ระบุ Current Stage, Source of Truth, Next Stage, งานค้าง
3. ห้ามแก้ไฟล์ที่ไม่ได้อยู่ใน scope ของ phase ปัจจุบัน
4. ทุก code change ต้องผ่าน build/typecheck
5. จบ session ด้วย closing format (section 0.4)
6. ห้าม git operations (Claude) — ดู section 0.2
7. อัปเดต Current Stage และ Changelog ทุกครั้งที่ทำงานเสร็จ

## 13) Snapshot Commit Policy

> กำหนด Option ที่เลือกสำหรับ runtime data commit

**Selected**: Option B — Never commit runtime data to git

- Runtime JSON/JSONL/TXT files generated at runtime are NEVER committed
- `.gitignore` enforces this at repo root and dashboard level
- `docs/RUNTIME_FILES_GIT_POLICY.md` documents the full policy
- Dashboard mirror files under `dashboard/app/public/data/` are excluded from git

---

## 14) Production Hardening / Safety Guardrails

> กฎที่ห้ามละเมิดในทุกสถานการณ์

```
LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED=false       # must remain false until migration gate passes
ENABLE_ORDER_PLACEMENT=false     # must remain false until migration gate passes
PRODUCTION_TRADING_READY=false   # must remain false until migration gate passes
EXCHANGE_MANUAL_APPROVAL=        # must NOT be set to "approved" without evidence
```

- ห้าม place/cancel/replace real order ในทุก phase
- ห้าม call BingX private API ที่มีผลต่อ account โดยไม่มี paper evidence
- ห้าม expose API key/secret ใน repo หรือ client-side
- ห้าม breaking change `/api/plan-status` contract
- ห้าม fallback ไป mirror/cache แบบเงียบๆ โดยไม่บอก operator

---

## 15) Live Validation & Monitoring

> checklist สำหรับ operator ก่อน phase M-0B จะเริ่มได้

- [ ] Codex push latest working tree to GitHub main
- [ ] Plesk: `git pull origin main` + `npm run build` EXIT:0 + restart Node app
- [ ] `BINGX_AGENT_DIR=/var/www/vhosts/ob-gate.com/httpdocs` set in Plesk env
- [ ] `/api/health` returns `ok:true` on server
- [ ] `/api/plan-status` returns structured JSON (not HTML/login page)
- [ ] `/api/paper-performance` returns paper metrics
- [ ] `/api/operator-evidence` returns evidence pack
- [ ] `/api/m0b-preflight` returns preflight status
- [ ] `/api/exchange-readiness` returns readiness checks
- [ ] `/api/runtime-audit` returns runtime file audit
- [ ] `/public` dashboard visible, no crash, DashboardDiagnosticsCard visible
- [ ] Paper journal has entries with `averageFillPrice` set
- [ ] `paperDataQuality.hasAverageFillPrice: true` in paper-performance
- [ ] Operator manually reviews paper results
- [ ] `EXCHANGE_MANUAL_APPROVAL=approved` set after evidence review
- [ ] Phase M-0B can begin

## 16) Roadmap — Next Phases

> See section 0.1 Project Status for detailed Phase M-0L/M-0B blocking conditions.

### Priority Matrix
| Priority | Task |
|----------|------|
| P0 | Codex push working tree to GitHub main |
| P0 | Operator Plesk deploy + BINGX_AGENT_DIR + endpoint checks |
| P0 | Paper fill evidence (`averageFillPrice`) |
| P0 | No live trading / no real orders / no secret exposure |
| P1 | Phase M-0B — Read-only Exchange API Implementation (after gate) |
| P2 | Phase M-0C+ — Further exchange integration |

### Roadmap Rules
- ทุก phase ต้องเริ่มจากอ่าน PROJECT_MAP.md
- ทุก phase ต้องไม่เปลี่ยน source of truth แบบเงียบ
- ทุก phase ต้อง update Project Status + Changelog
- ทุก phase ต้องมี validation
- ทุก phase ต้องแยก paper/live ให้ชัด
- ทุก phase ต้อง default safe mode
- ห้าม phase ใดเปิด live trading โดยไม่มี manual approval และ migration gate
